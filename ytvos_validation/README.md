Related to issue #19: This directory contains a version of the code that produces 72% overall result on the the YouTubeVOS 2018 validation benchmark.
This is a work in progress that will be integrated with the main code eventually.

TODOs:

* Retest on the published weights.
* Clean up optimizer.py, discriminator.py and memory.py without reducing the benchmark score in the process.
